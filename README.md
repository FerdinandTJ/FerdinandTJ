## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm a Bachelor's student at Universitas Pertamina, with a strong interest in software development and programming. I have experience in Java, Python, C, and C++, and I am always looking to learn more and expand my skillset.

Currently, I am focused on honing my programming skills, working on various projects, and studying web programming. This repository is where I share my personal projects, assignments, and experiments as I continue to grow as a developer.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and provide feedback. I am open to collaborations and discussions to enhance my learning journey!
